<p class="white">Even before the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, Flint helped develop Coyne into the 2016 Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award winner as the top player in NCAA Division I women’s ice hockey. Until Thursday, among her long list of distinguished awards, a silver medal at the 2014 games topped the list.</p>
<p class="white">In addition, under his tutelage, 2014 Olympic bronze medalist and MVP Florence Schelling, DMSB’13, goaltender for the Swiss team again this year, graduated as the program’s all-time leader in career goals against average (1.74) and save percentage (.940). Schelling is the first Northeastern student-athlete in history to appear in four different Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="white">“To see them on the world stage, it’s so rewarding to know I had a part in developing them as hockey players and as people,” Flint said.</p>
<p class="white">We asked the coach to reflect on the game of women’s hockey.</p>
